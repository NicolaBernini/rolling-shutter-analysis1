    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "CMOS Sensor have different advantages like \n",
    "\n",
    "  * low cost \n",
    "  * good performance \n",
    "  \n",
    "but also a major disadvantage \n",
    "\n",
    "  * rolling shutter \n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Rolling Shutter consists of *reading the sensor line by line*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** that while reading the image can change \n",
    "\n",
    "* the last line could not be anymore consistent with the first line \n",
    "* it could lead to **non consistent images** (absurd ones)\n",
    "\n",
    "This phenomenon does not happen with CCD and Mechanical Shutters providing **Global Shutter**\n",
    "\n",
    "* With G.S. the sensor is exposed and then \"isolated\" (can not change anymore because of scene changes) for a very small time \n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "With Shutter the problem is **time** \n",
    "\n",
    "* Global Shutters expose the sensor for a time interval very small \n",
    "    * then it is possible to assume the scene as static (for the vast majority of the phenomena of interest) \n",
    "* Rolling Shutter could be too slow wrt some phenomena happening in the scene \n",
    "    * theh it is not possible to assume the scene as static anymore \n",
    "\n",
    "<br/> \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence it is possible to think at Rolling Shutter Camera as a device producing an image where each pixel should carry the extra information (beside color of course) of **timestamp** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Timestamping Pixels \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the following Parameters for a Rolling Shutter Camera \n",
    "\n",
    "* $ t_{\\tau} $ (constant) Time for a complete scan of the sensor \n",
    "  * It should be provided on the Sensor Datasheet \n",
    "* $ t_{id} $ (constant) Idle Time (when switching from one frame to another)\n",
    "  * It should be provided on the Sensor Datasheet \n",
    "* $ u_{i} = \\{ (r,c) \\}_{i} (Bidimensional Array) $ the $ i $ frame made of pixels with $ r,c $ row and column coordinates \n",
    "* $ m $ (constant) Number of Lines in the sensor \n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now build the $ t(u,i) $ *Pixel Timestamp Function* that associates to each pixel in $ u_{i} $ the appropriate timestamp \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build this function, it is enough to compute the timestamp for each pixel according considering that \n",
    "\n",
    "* lines are read subsequently \n",
    "  * hence it is possible to think about the percentage of $ t_{\\tau} $ total frame time consumed to read the first $ r $ lines over the $ m $ total number of lines \n",
    "\n",
    "then the final formula is as follows \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ t((r,c), i) = t_{i} + t_{\\tau} \\frac{r}{m} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transformation among frames \n",
    "\n",
    "In Rolling Shutter Cameras the effects of \n",
    "\n",
    "* self-motion \n",
    "* not static scene \n",
    "\n",
    "lead to distorsions such as \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://www.andor.com/Portals/0/rolling-global2.jpg\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "varying depending on the kind of motion \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence Transformations like for example Homography (holding when no translation is present) should be changed \n",
    "\n",
    "* In case of Pixels consistency (hence Global Shutter) they hold for all the Image \n",
    "* In case of Pixels non-consistency (hence Rolling Shutter) they hold for **each pixel separately**\n",
    "  * This is because of Transformation for each pixel can be different \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence the Rotation Transformation \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ u_{i} = KR(t)u_{j} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "holding between frame $ u_{i} $ and frame $ u_{j} $ has to be interpreted as follows \n",
    "\n",
    "* for Global Shutter \n",
    "  * $ R(t) $ is the same for all the pixels \n",
    "* for Rolling Shutter \n",
    "  * $ R(t) $ changes for every pixel hence \n",
    "    * it becomes $ R(t(r,c)) $ where $ r,c $ are the row and column coordinates of the pixel \n",
